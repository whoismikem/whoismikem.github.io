# Machine Learning - Understanding

## Basics
* Finding Patterns
* Example Uses:
    - Recommendations
    - Speech Recognition
    - Language Translation
    - Facial Recognition

## The Recipe
1. Start with Data - Contains patterns
2. Feed data into ML algorithm(s) - Finds patterns
3. Model is generated - Code for recognizing patterns
4. Applications can use model - model returns probability

## ML Process
* Iterative - Data patterns are extracted
* First Problem: Asking the right question - Asking the right question is most important part of process
    - Do you have the right data to answer the question
    - How will success be measured - What's acceptable 
1. Choose data (raw data)
    - Raw data is usually not in right form
    - Pre-processing will be needed
    - Prepared data can be used for training
    - Most time is spending preparing data
2. Prepared data is used to train model
    - Iterate over candidate model until success is reached
* ML is a iterative process
* Common to use data from multiple sources

## Machine Learning Problems Category
* Regression
* Classification
* Clustering

## Machine Learning Algorithm Styles
* Regression
* Decision Tree
* Neural Network (Deep Learning)
* Bayesian
* K-means


## General Notes
* Ethics of ML - Models can be bias

Chrysler Town & Country suffer form a problem where the transmission cooler hoses start leaking transmission fluid. Following is a small guide what it takes to replace the old transmission fluid hose lines on a 2014 Town and Country with e v6 Flex Fuel Engine.

## What you need
* New/Replacement Transmission Cooler Hoses.
    - Dorman OE Solutions Automatic Transmission Oil Cooler Hose Assembly Part # 624-284 from (www.oreillyauto.com) - [Exact part link](https://www.oreillyauto.com/detail/b/dorman-oe-solutions-3387/engine-parts---mounts-16774/transmission---transaxle-16780/transmission-parts-16520/at-oil-cooler-hose-assembly-13309/4b224fe69969/dorman-oe-solutions-automatic-transmission-oil-cooler-hose-assembly/624284/5729865/2014/chrysler/town---country?q=transmission+cooler+lines&pos=0)
* Hook and Pick Tool set. 
    - Hoses are secured with clips. Hook set is helpful in getting them out. Check out how-to here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMjExcEJkZ8&t=155s>
* Automatic Transmission Fluid. 
    - I use MOPAR only fluids [Genuine Chrysler Accessories (5013458AA) (68218058AC) ATF+4 Automatic Transmission Fluid - 1.3 Gallon / 5 Liter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BV4D182/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

## Steps
The two hoses attach to the top of the transmission on one end and to a radiator cooler, that is in front of the main radiator under the front grill, on the other end. The hoses are secured using some strange clip system that is tough to work with. Also checking the transmission fluid levels is a situation on it's own.

* Disconnect and remove the battery.
* Remove the battery platform by unbolting 3x 13mm bolts

    - With the battery platform removed, we have access to the hoses from the transmission end.
* Now lets gain access to the front side of the hoses by loosening the front grill and removing the radiator bracket. 
    * **NOTE:** There are two bolts which need to be removed, that are located under the grill plastic.

* Lift and move the front bracket out of the way. This gives more room to access the front side of the two hose lines.

* Using the hook tools remove the clips that secure the hose lines to transmission and transmission cooler. 
    * **NOTE:** [Check out helpful how-to here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMjExcEJkZ8&t=155s)
* Reinstall new hoses. 
    * **Note:** Make sure the clips are in before installing/inserting new lines

* Put things back together:
    - Reinstall the front bracket and grill
    - Reinstall the battery platform
    - Reinstall the battery and connect everything back up
* Check transmission fluid level and add fluid accordingly.

* Disconnect and remove the battery.
* Remove the battery platform by unbolting 3x 13mm bolts

    - With the battery platform removed, we have access to the hoses from the transmission end.
* Now lets gain access to the front side of the hoses by loosening the front grill and removing the radiator bracket.
